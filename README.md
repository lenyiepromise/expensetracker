Developing a web app within three days is wild. It may not be though, but for a group of final year Computer Science students, in the University of Port Harcourt (UNIPORT), it is.
Spentrack is an expense tracker app initiated and developed by Group 11, as grouped by Dr. Helen, CSc rep to GES for the final year GES 400.1 project.
This is my own version of the app- though it wasn't accepted by my team (members of Group 11)
